# Long Division Tutorial Tool

This tool will make it easy for elementary school kids to learn long division because it chooses a random division problem, and (divides) each problem into multiple steps where kids can interact and provide answers when prompted. A correct answer will be rewarded with virtual coins, and wrong answers will cost nothing. However, asking the tool to explain the solution *will* cost some virtual coins.

## How to run the game

```
git clone https://github.com/mutawa/division`
cd division
open index.html
```
